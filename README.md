# Medium Volume

Howdy! You've reached the barren and sad website of Nicholas Dal Porto.

## What the heck is this website

I got the domain for free though a GitHub Student giveaway. So, this single page will serve until I find the time to make the rest of the site.

## About Me

I'm a high school senior at Design Tech High School. Outside of school, I have several hobbies/passions. One is FIRST Robotics, where I help build large-scale competition robots and volunteer as a Control Systems Advisor. I tinker with various engineering projects, buy odd computer and electronic hardware, and tend to a collection of 35+ vintage computers. I also love bicycling, both mountain and road, and enjoy writing as well.
